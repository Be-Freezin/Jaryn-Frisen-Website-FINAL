            Manitoba Country Music Associations 2021 Roots Artist of The Year
            nominee, Jaryn Friesen, combines his raw sound built on the
            foundation of honky-tonk and outlaw music from the 70's with his
            hearty lyrics and story telling to create honest country and western
            music.
          </p>
          <p class="bio-desription">
            From a young boy, Jaryn has been thrown into a world of music. "My
            dad and I would spend hours going through old records and cassettes.
            He has such a unique taste in music and in-depth knowledge of
            artists, their songs and their lives so it was hard not to fall in
            love with these guys.". Ever since playing his first keyboard at 5
            years old, Jaryn has been writing music and sharing it with everyone
            he thought would listen.
          </p>
          <p class="bio-description">
            After traveling across Manitoba, playing many festivals and shows
            and recording EP's with bands from his younger years, Jaryn is ready
            for his stories and music to be heard. Writing from his own personal
            experiences and life journey, which includes both hard times and
            good times, Jaryn shines through the many streams in which his music
            flows. He relies on his band and their cowboy songs to put on a loud
            Rock N Roll show that gets the party started, or his guitar and
            vulnerable, witty stories to capture the crowd from every stage he
            plays on.
          </p>
          <p class="bio-description">
            Having already worked with some of Canada's most talented artists
            and getting nominated as Manitoba's 2021 Roots Artists of The Year,
            Jaryn Friesen's honest, hard working, versatile sound, prepares him
            perfectly for stages in both mainstream and roots music in Canada.
